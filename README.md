## Dynamic Product Routing Using React Router
  ### Introduction
  This project provides dynamic product routing in a product site. I utilize various routing techniques such as the **react-router-dom** and hooks (useParams) to achieve its   full functionality. This project will enable users to browse products within a specific category and retrieve all relevant details for a particular product. I use the Fake   Store API to fetch and display product data, categories, and products in the store.
  
  Nested dynamic routing concepts are employed to showcase the products within a particular category and provide a comprehensive view of individual product details.



## Technologies Used
- **React** - UI library;component based
